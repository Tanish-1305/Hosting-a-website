- Now, to use ``Nginx`` in our container use the following commands:
```bash
docker pull nginx
```
```bash
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 nginx
```
# Type the instance's IP and see Nginx default web page.  
- Use following command to stop the container from running:
```bash
ctrl + c

- Use following command to reveals that the Docker container has been exited:
```bash
docker ps -a
```
- Use following command to see container's ID
```bash
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d nginx
```
- Use following command to see new information about container:
```bash
docker ps
```
- Use following command to stop the container:
```bash
docker stop docker-nginx
```
- Then remove default Nginx page and create new custom html file using following commands:
```bash
docker rm docker-nginx
```
```bash
mkdir -p ~/docker-nginx/html
```
Now navigate to file created:
```bash
cd ~/docker-nginx/html
```
- Now create a ``index.html`` and write a html code on ``vim`` code editor:
```bash
vi index.html
```
- Now write your code and save the file.
Then connect the file to instance:
```bash
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d -v ~/docker-nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```
